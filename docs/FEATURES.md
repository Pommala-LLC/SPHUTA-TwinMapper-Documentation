## Feature Classification

| Classification | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Core | Baseline product capability, present by default |
| Additional | Required completeness item for production-ready Spring-first baseline |
| Optional | Explicit opt-in, property-gated, default false |

## Document Engine Features

### Core

**Compile-time DTO generation**
DTOs are generated from fixed YAML, JSON, or BPMN definitions at build time. Never generated from runtime payloads. Never inferred from live input samples.

**Enum generation**
Enums generated from declared definition values. Strict enum validation. Enum-to-code and code-to-enum mapping. String-to-enum and enum-to-string mapping. Deprecated enum alias support when configured.

**Metadata generation**
Field descriptors, type descriptors, alias descriptors, default value metadata, required/optional metadata, deprecated/forbidden metadata, version metadata, source-to-target metadata, generation metadata.

**Binder generation**
Format-aware binder classes generated at compile time. Separate binder for JSON, YAML, and BPMN. Constructor and record-based population. Nested object binding. Collection and map binding. Alias-aware field reading. Default value population. Required-field enforcement. Strict unknown-field rejection.

**Validator generation**
Schema-constraint validator classes generated from definition rules. Required, default, enum, forbidden, deprecated, conditional, one-of, mutually exclusive, min, max, minLength, maxLength, regex/pattern, unknown-field, and collection/map type checks.

**Registry generation**
Binder registry, object mapper registry, metadata registry, converter registry, and type lookup registry — all generated and populated at compile time.

**Runtime YAML binding**
Parses YAML documents using SnakeYAML into `NodeCursor`, dispatches to generated binders, populates generated DTOs.

**Runtime JSON binding**
Parses JSON documents using Jackson into `NodeCursor`, dispatches to generated binders, populates generated DTOs.

**Runtime BPMN binding**
Parses BPMN XML using JDK StAX with XXE disabled into `BpmnIntermediateModel`, adapts to `NodeCursor`, dispatches to generated binders, populates generated DTOs.

**NodeCursor abstraction**
Format-neutral document traversal. Supports field existence checks, required and optional scalar reads, enum reads, nested object access, list children, map children, path tracking, and type mismatch reporting.

---

### Additional

**JSON naming consistency**
`@JsonNaming`, `@JsonAlias`, `PropertyNamingStrategies` on generated DTOs. `Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilderCustomizer` registered by starter for alignment between TwinMapper-generated DTOs and Spring Boot's auto-configured `ObjectMapper`.

**`MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter` integration**
When TwinMapper DTOs are used as Spring MVC REST request or response bodies, the standard Spring MVC converter is the integration point.

**Secure SnakeYAML construction**
`new Yaml(new SafeConstructor(new LoaderOptions()))` mandatory. Default SnakeYAML constructor allows arbitrary Java object deserialization and is prohibited.

**`spring.config.import` support**
`ConfigDataLoader` and `ConfigDataLocationResolver` for Spring Boot 2.4+ allow TwinMapper definitions to be imported via `spring.config.import=twinmapper:classpath:/definitions/`.

**XXE-safe BPMN parsing**
`XMLInputFactory.IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES` set to `false` and `XMLInputFactory.SUPPORT_DTD` set to `false` — both required, omitting either is a security vulnerability.

**Mandatory `ResourceLoader` for BPMN**
All BPMN classpath file resolution uses Spring `ResourceLoader` — required for correctness in OSGi, GraalVM native image, and application server deployments.

---

### Optional

**Bounded runtime discovery helpers**
Adapter-specific, explicit opt-in only, produces traceable artifacts, never replaces fixed-definition mode.
Property: `twinmapper.binding.bounded-discovery.enabled`

**Alias/fallback compatibility resolution**
Resolves deprecated aliases, legacy field names, and renamed fields during binding.
Property: `twinmapper.compatibility-resolution.enabled`

---

## Object Engine Features

### Core

**Create mapping**
Generates a new target object by reading all declared field mappings from the source object.

**Update mapping**
Applies source field values onto an existing target object. Preserves identity and audit fields unless explicitly mapped. Default null policy: `IGNORE_NULLS`.

**Patch mapping**
Applies only non-null source field values onto an existing target object. Mandatory null policy: `IGNORE_NULLS`.

**Inverse mapping**
Generates a reverse mapper from the same mapping definition. Build-time failure if inverse generation is ambiguous or unsafe.

**Nested mapping**
Maps nested source property paths to nested target property paths and vice versa.

**Flattening**
Maps nested source properties into flat target fields. Example: `address.city` → `city`.

**Expansion**
Maps flat source fields into a nested target object. Example: `city` + `zip` → `address`.

**Collection mapping**
`List<S>` → `List<T>`, `Set<S>` → `Set<T>`. Element mapper dispatched per item.

**Map mapping**
`Map<K1,V1>` → `Map<K2,V2>`. Key converter and value mapper applied per entry.

**Converter-assisted mapping**
Field-level and type-level converter support. Value object converters. Enum/code converters. Scalar conversions when declared. Registered via definition config, programmatic API, or optional annotation.

**Null-policy-aware mapping**
`IGNORE_NULLS`, `SET_NULLS`, `FAIL_ON_NULL`. Configurable per mapping, per profile, or per field.

**Reusable mapping profiles**
Shared null/update policies, unmapped target policy, shared converters, shared ignore rules, and common mapping defaults. Reduces repetition across enterprise-scale mapping configurations.

**Supported mapping flows**
All of the following are first-class supported:

| Source | Target |
|---|---|
| DTO | DTO |
| Entity | Domain |
| Domain | Entity |
| Domain | DTO |
| DTO | Domain |
| Entity | DTO |
| DTO | Entity |
| Entity | Projection |
| Projection | DTO |
| Request / Command | Domain |
| Domain | Response / View / Event |
| Patch DTO | Entity |
| Patch DTO | Domain |

---

### Additional

**`ConversionService` integration**
Spring `ConversionService`, `GenericConversionService`, `FormattingConversionService`, `DefaultConversionService` as the converter backend in Spring applications. `Converter`, `ConverterFactory`, `GenericConverter`, `ConditionalGenericConverter` as the SPI contracts for custom converters.

**`BeanWrapper` usage**
Used in UPDATE and PATCH mode when mutating an existing Spring-managed bean target. Handles nested property paths, type conversion, and JPA-loaded proxy targets transparently.

**`DirectFieldAccessor` usage**
Used when the target has no setters — for example, value objects with final fields.

**Proxy-safe reflection**
`AopUtils.getTargetClass()`, `AopProxyUtils.ultimateTargetClass()`, `ProxyUtils.getUserClass()` mandatory for any reflection-based operation on Spring-managed beans. Omitting these causes silent failures on proxied targets.

**Generated bean disambiguation**
`@Qualifier`, `@Primary`, `@Conditional` optionally emitted on generated mapper beans for Spring applications with multiple mappers targeting the same type pair.

---

### Optional

**Controlled convention-based mapping mode**
Enabled only when explicitly configured. Source and target types must be strongly compatible. Ambiguity causes build-time or runtime failure — never silent resolution.
Property: `twinmapper.objectmap.convention-mapping.enabled`

**Reflection-based compatibility helpers**
Limited reflection-assisted mapping for migration and legacy onboarding. Never the default runtime path. Proxy-aware via `AopUtils`/`AopProxyUtils`/`ProxyUtils`.
Property: `twinmapper.objectmap.reflection-compat.enabled`

---

## Validation Features

### Core

**Required field validation** — Missing required fields produce `BindingError` with full field path.

**Optional field handling** — Absent optional fields trigger default application when a default is declared.

**Default value application** — Static and expression-derived defaults applied at bind time.

**Enum validation** — Unknown enum values produce `BindingError` listing valid values.

**Forbidden field detection** — Forbidden or legacy field present produces `BindingError` with migration hint.

**Deprecated field handling** — Warning in COMPATIBLE mode, error in STRICT mode.

**Conditional required rules** — Requirement active only when a discriminator field matches a declared value.

**One-of rules** — Exactly one of a declared group of fields must be present.

**Mutually exclusive rules** — Declared fields must not appear together.

**Min / max validation** — Numeric range constraints on field values.

**MinLength / maxLength validation** — String length constraints on field values.

**Regex / pattern validation** — Pattern constraints on string field values.

**Unknown field validation** — Unknown fields rejected in STRICT mode, warned in COMPATIBLE.

**Collection and map type validation** — Element and entry type checks on collection and map fields.

**Path-aware aggregated reporting** — All validation errors collected into `ValidationReport` with full field paths, file names, and line/column where available.

---

### Additional

**Spring validation chain integration**
Generated validators implementable as Spring `Validator`. `ConstraintValidatorFactory` for Spring-injected custom constraint validators. `HandlerMethodArgumentResolver` for Spring MVC method parameter binding. `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` alignment for clean translation of `MethodArgumentNotValidException` and `ConstraintViolationException`.

---

## Strictness Modes

### STRICT (default)
Rejects unknown fields, invalid enum values, missing required fields, ambiguous mappings, incompatible types without declared converter, unsafe inverse generation.

### COMPATIBLE
Allows deprecated aliases, certain compatibility warnings, controlled backward-compatible interpretation.

### LENIENT
Migration tooling only. Not the default. Not for production use.

---

## Code Generation Features

### Core

**DSL strategy**
TwinMapper-native YAML DSL. Not JSON Schema. Purpose-built for code generation and object mapping.

**DSL constructs supported:**
- `definitionSet` (name, version, package, strict mode)
- Object types and enum types
- Fields with type, required, optional, default, targetName, aliases, deprecatedAliases, description, constraints
- Constraints: min, max, minLength, maxLength, pattern, oneOf, mutuallyExclusive
- Forbidden and deprecated field declarations
- Object mappings with name, sourceType, targetType, mode, profile, inverseOf, field mappings
- Profiles with nullPolicy, unmappedTargetPolicy, converters, ignoreTargets
- Converters with name, sourceType, targetType
- Generation options for DTO style, builder support, binder/validator/mapper generation

**Build-time pipeline:**
1. Scan definition directories
2. Parse definitions into internal meta-model
3. Validate definitions
4. Normalize into format-neutral meta-model
5. Generate Java sources into `build/generated/sources/twinmapper`
6. Compile generated and handwritten code together

---

### Additional

**`basePackage` configuration**
Aligns generated code package structure with the consuming application's package to avoid Java module system split-package issues.

**Generated source registration**
Gradle: `sourceSets.main.java.srcDir(generatedDir)`. Maven: `project.addCompileSourceRoot(generatedDir)`. Both register the generated source root for IDE and compilation.

---

## Spring Boot Integration Features

### Core

**`TwinMapperProperties`**
`@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "twinmapper")` covering strictness mode, definition locations, generation options, optional feature flags, and compatibility toggles. Foundational — every `@ConditionalOnProperty` in the starter depends on it.

**Auto-configuration**
`@AutoConfiguration`, `@ConditionalOnClass`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`, `@ConditionalOnProperty`, `AutoConfiguration.imports` for Spring Boot 3.x/4.x.

---

### Additional

**`@EnableConfigurationProperties(TwinMapperProperties.class)`**
Declared in auto-configuration class. Required for property binding to work.

**`spring-configuration-metadata.json`**
Under `META-INF/` in the starter. Provides IDE auto-completion for all `twinmapper.*` properties with descriptions, types, and default values.

**Named application events**
- `TwinMapperBindingSuccessEvent`
- `TwinMapperBindingFailureEvent`
- `TwinMapperMappingSuccessEvent`
- `TwinMapperMappingFailureEvent`

Published via `ApplicationEventPublisher` for observability in Spring applications.

**Actuator `InfoContributor`**
Exposes registered mapper counts, supported formats, and strictness mode.

**Actuator `HealthIndicator`**
Reports whether all required definition files loaded successfully at startup.

**Test support**
`@ImportAutoConfiguration(TwinMapperAutoConfiguration.class)` for test slice inclusion. `@AutoConfigureTwinMapper` test annotation following the `@AutoConfigureMockMvc` pattern. `spring-boot-test-autoconfigure` as test-scoped dependency.

**Explicit activation annotations**
`@EnableTwinMapper`, `@EnableTwinMapperBinding`, `@EnableTwinMapperObjectEngine` for non-Boot or highly controlled Spring contexts where auto-configuration is not used.

---

### Optional

**Annotation-heavy usage mode**
Annotations as alternative configuration style. Definition files remain primary source of truth.
Property: `twinmapper.annotations.enabled`

---

## Developer Tooling Features

### Core

**Definition validation** — Validate definition files without running code generation.

**Dry-run generation** — Run full codegen pipeline and report what would be generated without writing files.

**Definition linting** — Report structural and semantic issues in definition files.

**Offline inspection** — Inspect and report on existing generated output.

**CLI boot hardening** — `SpringApplication.setWebApplicationType(WebApplicationType.NONE)` mandatory to prevent embedded servlet container startup.

---

### Optional

**Sample-to-definition assistant**
Inspects sample YAML, JSON, or BPMN inputs and proposes draft TwinMapper definitions. Requires human review. Never automatic live schema learning. CLI flag activation only — not a runtime property.

---

## Diagnostics and Error Handling

All errors include: error code, definition name, field path, source file, line/column where available, target Java type, rule violated, and migration hint for forbidden/deprecated field errors.

| Error Code | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD` | Required field absent in input |
| `UNKNOWN_FIELD` | Field not declared in definition (STRICT mode) |
| `FORBIDDEN_FIELD` | Field declared as forbidden or legacy |
| `DEPRECATED_FIELD` | Deprecated alias used (warning or error by mode) |
| `INVALID_ENUM` | Enum value not in declared set |
| `TYPE_MISMATCH` | Field value incompatible with declared type |
| `CONDITIONAL_VIOLATION` | Conditional constraint failed |
| `ONE_OF_VIOLATION` | One-of constraint failed |
| `MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE_VIOLATION` | Mutually exclusive fields both present |
| `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION` | Min/max/length/pattern constraint failed |
| `AMBIGUOUS_MAPPING` | Convention mapping could not resolve uniquely |
| `UNSAFE_INVERSE` | Inverse mapper generation is ambiguous or unsafe |

---

## Hard Non-Goals

These are not features and must not be implemented in any form.

- Uncontrolled live schema learning
- Silent hidden guessing
- Runtime-first architecture
- Domain-specific semantics in the core platform

---

## External to TwinMapper

Not TwinMapper features. Enabled by TwinMapper SPIs but built and owned outside the platform.

- Customer-specific domain extension packs (finance, insurance, workflow, healthcare, and similar)

---

## Roadmap Beyond V1

Not part of the current release.

- Union/discriminator-capable types
- JSON-based object-mapping DSL
- Arbitrary additional definition DSL formats
- Annotation-first architecture
