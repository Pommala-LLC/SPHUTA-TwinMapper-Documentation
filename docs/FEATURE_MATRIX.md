# TwinMapper — Formal Feature Matrix

This is the locked writing baseline for TwinMapper. All seven buckets are explicitly separated: Core, Additional, Optional, Open Implementation Decisions, Hard Non-Goals, External, and Roadmap Beyond V1.

---

## Core

The default TwinMapper product shape. Fourteen core modules, compile-time-first document binding and typed object mapping, Spring-native validation and conversion integration, and `TwinMapperProperties` as a foundational starter contract. `twinmapper-runtime` is explicitly limited to shared contracts, utilities, and abstractions only. Binding and object-mapping implementations live in the two runtime submodules.

## Optional

All six optional capabilities are explicit opt-in, property-gated, default `false` where applicable, and must never replace generated binders or mappers as the primary path. Each runtime-gated option has a concrete property key.

| Feature | Bucket | Module / Home | Default | Activation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Controlled convention-based mapping mode | Optional | `twinmapper-runtime-objectmap` | No | `twinmapper.objectmap.convention-mapping.enabled=false` | Deterministic opt-in only; ambiguity causes failure, never silent resolution |
| Annotation-heavy usage mode | Optional | `twinmapper-annotations`, `twinmapper-annotation-processor`, starter | No | `twinmapper.annotations.enabled=false` | Convenience mode only; definition files remain primary source of truth |
| Reflection-based compatibility helpers | Optional | `twinmapper-runtime-objectmap` | No | `twinmapper.objectmap.reflection-compat.enabled=false` | For migration and legacy onboarding only; proxy-aware via `AopUtils`/`AopProxyUtils`/`ProxyUtils`; never the default runtime path |
| Bounded runtime discovery helpers | Optional | `twinmapper-runtime-binding` | No | `twinmapper.binding.bounded-discovery.enabled=false` | Adapter-specific; bounded and auditable only; never replaces fixed-definition mode |
| Alias/fallback compatibility resolution | Optional | `twinmapper-runtime-binding`, `twinmapper-runtime-objectmap` | No | `twinmapper.compatibility-resolution.enabled=false` | Policy-controlled compatibility bridge; never hidden guessing |
| Sample-to-definition assistant tooling | Optional | `twinmapper-cli` | No | CLI flag only — not a runtime property | Developer tooling only; requires human review; never automatic live schema learning |

---

## Open Implementation Decisions

These are explicitly not features. They must stay outside Core, Additional, and Optional. Both must be resolved before implementation of their respective modules begins.

| Item | Bucket | Module / Home | Default | Activation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Source writer tool choice | Open Decision | `twinmapper-codegen` | N/A | Must decide before implementation | Must be Spring-neutral and actively maintained; candidates include Freemarker/Mustache template-based generation using Spring's templating support; must not introduce a Micronaut dependency |
| `DefinitionSet` runtime identity mechanism | Open Decision | `twinmapper-definition-model` / `twinmapper-runtime` | N/A | Must decide before implementation | Candidates: registry bean, classpath metadata file, or Spring `Environment` property |

---

## Hard Non-Goals

Explicitly excluded from all implementation. Must not appear in any phase or module.

| Item | Bucket | Module / Home | Default | Activation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Uncontrolled live schema learning | Hard Non-Goal | None | N/A | Never | Explicitly excluded |
| Silent hidden guessing | Hard Non-Goal | None | N/A | Never | Explicitly excluded |
| Runtime-first architecture | Hard Non-Goal | None | N/A | Never | Compile-time-first is locked |
| Domain-specific semantics in core | Hard Non-Goal | None | N/A | Never | Core remains generic |

---

## External

Outside TwinMapper itself. Enabled by TwinMapper's SPI and extension model but built and owned separately.

| Item | Bucket | Module / Home | Default | Activation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Customer-specific domain extension packs | External | Outside TwinMapper | N/A | Separate artifacts | Finance, insurance, workflow, healthcare, and similar packs built by customers or partners using TwinMapper SPIs |

---

## Roadmap Beyond V1

Not part of the current implementation baseline. May be addressed in future releases.

| Item | Bucket | Module / Home | Default | Activation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Union/discriminator-capable types | Deferred from V1 | Future | N/A | Later phase | Deferred until base DSL, codegen, and binder runtime are stable |
| JSON-based object-mapping DSL | Deferred from V1 | Future | N/A | Later phase | YAML DSL is the only mapping DSL in V1 |
| Arbitrary additional definition DSL formats | Deferred from V1 | Future | N/A | Later phase | New formats addable via SPI in future releases |
| Annotation-first architecture | Deferred from V1 | Future | N/A | Later phase | Annotations remain optional convenience only in V1 |

---

## Final Bucket Summary

|---|---|
| Core | Baseline product; present and active by default |
| Additional | Required Spring-grade completeness; must be present before implementation is production-ready |
| Optional | Explicit opt-in; property-gated; default false; must never replace the generated primary path |
| Open Decision | Unresolved implementation choices; not features; must be resolved before the relevant module is implemented |
| Hard Non-Goal | Explicitly excluded from all implementation in any form |
